2002-08-08: v0.1.0.7

	:BUGFIX: Various fixes

	:ADDED: Audio-streaming functions have been added, to
	simplify replaying any kind of audio, as long as it's
	fed into a buffer.

2002-01-13: v0.1.0.6

	:ADDED: The makefile can now now convert a GCC-compatible
	link-library by processing with hunk2aout.

	:ADDED: crt0.S (and crt0.o, when compiled) is the official
	startup-code for GCC targets. This was needed because GCC
	could place data first in the code-section.

	:BUGFIX: _DummySprite is now a pointer, and chip-memory is
	allocated for it in _SetupScreen. When linking, GCC silently
	swallowed the fact that it couldn't handle a chip-BSS
	section and fetched the incorrect pointer in a different
	part of the executable (_Cos1024 became _GreyscalePalette
	in SetupMath()). VLink brought this to my attention.

	:CHANGE: Added rules to all targets. This allows the Makefile
	to be successfully processed by GNU make, and removes the
	requirement by the user to have any commercial tools
	installed.

2002-01-12: v0.1.0.5

	:CHANGE: Vector matrix-routines now use the stack for
	temporary data instead of BSS-sections. This makes
	them completely re-entrant, and adds for more
	possibilities. I also learned how to use LINK/UNLK
	in the process.

2002-01-05: v0.1.0.3

	:BUGFIX: Fixed a nasty memory-trash in the matrix-
	routines. One step closer to having the temporary
	data on the stack...

2002-01-01:

	Happy new year!

2001-12-28: v0.1.0.2

	:CHANGE: Output-directories changed for everything, making it
	very easy to clean the project.

	:CHANGE: Output-file parser changed(rexx-script passed to PhxAss),
	allowing for more flexible filenames. Now the .s.o rule is applied
	for all files.

2001-12-27: v0.1.0.1

	:CHANGE: Object-output directory has been changed to obj/, to remove
	the clutter from src/

	:ADDED: WB-startup code added

2001-12-10: v0.1.0.0

	:ADDED: FPU 4x4 matrix-math code has been added to the project.

		New functions:

			Matrix_Identity()
			Matrix_Rotate()
			Matrix_Translate()
			Matrix_Scale()
			Matrix_Multiply()
			Matrix_Apply()
			Matrix_Invert()

	:ADDED: FPU detection code has been added, with flags controlling
	the actions taken.

	:CHANGE: Changed the entire source to compile on a per-function basis
	  instead of on a per-file basis. This reduces the size of the final
	  executable quite a bit, and allows for a completely new kind
	  of functions, as if they aren't used, they won't be included
	  anyway.
