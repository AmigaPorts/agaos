Debugging
---------

This debugging assumes that you use PhxLnk or a compatible linker.

The entire link-library is built with line-debugging enabled to assist
in tracking down enforcer-hits and similar problems.

Debug: Remember to pass KICK1 to PhxLnk when using the debugging-info,
as programs like 'FindHit' (used to locate enforcer-hits) cannot handle
the newer kind of RELOC-hunks (like RELOC32SHORT for example) when
loading the executable.

Release: When building the release executable, you just pass NODEBUG to
PhxLnk, and all the extra info will be stripped from the final executable.
